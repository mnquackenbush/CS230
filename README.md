Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client required a completed software design template for their gaming application "Draw It or Lose It!". Prior to the assignment, the client had optimized the game
for Android systems, but requested that the functionality of the app be expanded to be compatible across multiple apps. This included web-hosted client applications, as well as 
client applications native to specific Operating Systems (Mac OS, Windows, iOS, etc.).

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?soft

I felt that I did a particularly good job in comprehensively analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the various Operating Systems (Mac, Windows, Linux, and Mobile Platforms)
for their respective uses in Server Hosting, Client Development, and the variety of compatible tools used by each OS in software development.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The modular, step-by-step process of adding to the design document felt particularly helpful to me. Rather than trying to complete the entire document in one go, the needs of each section 
of the design document were completed in an iterative manner. Each subsequent section felt like it built on the prior section, making the resulting process seem more efficient and intuitive.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would spend a bit more time focusing on the security needs of The Gaming Room. Because the focus of the design document was to compare the various Operating Systems for their
strengths and weaknesses in developing the software of the application, I feel as if not much of the work was spent thinking about the security of the data. Granted, the application
would not host too much sensitive information compared to many other apps, but that doesn't mean security shouldn't still be a concious factor when developing any software, regardless of
the sensitivity of personal data being used. In revising this document, I'd focus on making the security considerations a bit more robust to suit these needs.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

In a customer-facing application, the user should be kept front of mind at all times during the development process. It is important to remember when developing software for a client
that the purpose of the agreement is to develop a program that effectively addresses (ideally) all of the needs of the target user of the software. If the user's needs aren't
a priority in development, the software will likely turn out to be quite different from what the client expected, rendering the development process inefficient and will potentially
reflect poorly on both parties of the agreement.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Over the course of this class, I learned the value of utilizing established design patterns when developing new software projects. Rather than attempting to "reinvent the wheel"
to suit the needs of the program, it is often more efficient to analyze the goals of the software to determine if there are pre-exisiting systems and patterns that suit the requirements
of the software being developed, so that the developers cognitive power can be better focused on the more creative and unique challenges required by the project.
